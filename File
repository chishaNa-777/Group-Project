The system reads text input from the user, separates words, and compares each word to entries stored in a SQLite database.
If any match is found, the message is flagged as containing offensive content.

1. User inputs a message.
2. Program splits the message into individual words.
3. Each word is compared to words stored in SQLite.
4. If a bad word exists → display a warning.
5. Otherwise → confirm the message is clean.
